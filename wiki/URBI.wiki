*URBI* (Universal Real-time Behavior Interface) is an open source cross-platform software platform in *C++* used to develop applications for robotics and complex systems. URBI is based on the UObject distributed *C++* component architecture. 
URBI includes the urbiScript orchestration language which is a parallel and event-driven script language. UObject components can be plugged into urbiscript and appear as native objects that can be scripted to specify their interactions and data exchanges.<br>
